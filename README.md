# Pool-Shot-Predictor
This is python project (created based on the video published by the Pool Shot Predictor Contest) that predicts the Cue Stick Aim and Object Ball path and determines if the ball is potted into the pockets of the Pool Table.
Custom Object Detection is done using YOLOv8 to detect cue stick, cue ball, object ball and pool table.
